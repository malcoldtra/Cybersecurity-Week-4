## Notes

This lab was a lot of fun! Challenge 5 was probably the most difficult because it required action from other users, but we weren't sure what that action was exactly.

## Installation Instructions

Setup instructions can be found on the Week 4 Lab page.

It should be noted that any browser can be used; however, Chrome and Firefox have one the most user-friendly Inspect Element interfaces.
